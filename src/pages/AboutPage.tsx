      <h2>About ScorePal</h2>
      <p>ScorePal is a simple, straight forward web app to track scores in any scenario. I built it to help my family keep track of scores more easily when we don't have a pen or paper handy.</p>
      <p>It is very feature-light and intends to stay this way, although I may add some quality of life changes ot improvements.</p>
      <p>I hope you find it as helpful as I do!</p>
